## Problem Statement
Python is popular amongst data scientists and researchers due to its ease of use. Build.AI is a GUI tool that makes comparing various machine learning models easier. Build.AI helps researchers and novice AI users get the best model for their dataset. It provides a seamless three-click experience or heavy customisation through the user-friendly dashboard. Build.AI can run 20+ models in the backend and display comparative visualisations.

## Potential Revenue Model
Since running multiple machine learning models on large datasets consumes a lot of computation power, we are aiming to provide a subscription model for users who would like to use our cloud hosted VMs or allow them to use their devices for free. The free model will be helpful for researchers with access to powerful GPUs and supercomputers wheras the paid model will be useful to users who are willing to shell some money for quick comparisons.

## Future Scope

- [ ] Enable hyper-parameter tuning
- [ ] Add more machine learning tasks, for eg. Computer Vision
- [ ] Include Deep Learning Models
